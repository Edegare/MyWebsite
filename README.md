# Edgar's Digital Realm

**Welcome to my personal portfolio website** â€“ an interactive digital space where you can learn more about me, explore my projects, skills, and reach out for collaboration/talk.

This project was built entirely by me as a way to **learn and strengthen my skills** in modern technologies like **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**.
It was my **first time working with most of the technologies and libraries used**, so building everything from scratch allowed me to gain valuable hands-on experience with them.
